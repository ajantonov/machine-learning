Key Ideas for Machine Learning

Key Ideas for Data Frames
1. Data is typically classified in software by type. 
2. Data types include continuous, discrete, categorical (which includes binary), and ordinal. 
3. Data typing in software acts as a signal to the software on how to process the data.

Key Ideas for Estimates of Locations
1. The basic metric for location is the mean, but it can be sensitive to extreme values (outlier). 
2. Other metrics (median, trimmed mean) are more robust.
